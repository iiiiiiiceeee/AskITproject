        <h2>Virus Infection</h2>

<p>If you suspect that your computer has been infected with a virus, it's important to take immediate action to mitigate the damage and remove the threat. Here's what you can do:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Disconnect from the Internet:</strong> If you suspect a virus infection, disconnect your computer from the Internet to prevent the virus from spreading to other devices or communicating with its command-and-control servers.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
        <strong>Enter Safe Mode:</strong> Boot your computer into Safe Mode. This mode loads only essential system files and drivers, which can help prevent the virus from running and make it easier to remove. To enter Safe Mode, restart your computer and repeatedly press the appropriate key (usually F8 or F12) during the boot process until you see the boot menu.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
        <strong>Run Antivirus Software:</strong> Use reputable antivirus or anti-malware software to scan your computer for viruses and other malicious software. If you already have antivirus software installed, run a full system scan. If not, you can download and use a reputable antivirus program from a trusted source.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
        <strong>Quarantine or Remove Infected Files:</strong> If the antivirus software detects any infected files, follow its instructions to quarantine or remove them from your computer. Quarantining isolates infected files from the rest of your system while removing them permanently deletes them.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
        <strong>Update Your Operating System and Software:</strong> Ensure that your operating system, antivirus software, web browsers, and other applications are up to date with the latest security patches and updates. Regularly updating your software helps protect against known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by viruses and malware.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
        <strong>Change Passwords:</strong> If you suspect that sensitive information such as passwords or financial details may have been compromised, change your passwords immediately, especially for accounts accessed from the infected computer.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
        <strong>Backup Important Data:</strong> Before taking any further action, backup important files and data to an external storage device or cloud storage service. This ensures that you don't lose any critical information in case further actions inadvertently cause data loss.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
        <strong>Restore from Backup (if necessary):</strong> If the virus infection has caused significant damage to your system and you're unable to remove it, you may need to restore your computer from a backup. Make sure you're restoring from a backup created before the virus infection occurred.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
        <strong>Seek Professional Help (if necessary):</strong> If you're unable to remove the virus on your own, or if you're unsure how to proceed, seek assistance from a professional computer repair service or IT specialist. They can help identify and remove the virus and provide guidance on securing your computer against future infections.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
        <strong>Educate Yourself:</strong> After dealing with the virus infection, take some time to educate yourself about safe computing practices, such as avoiding suspicious websites and email attachments, keeping software updated, and using strong, unique passwords.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>By following these steps, you can effectively deal with a virus infection on your computer and minimize the damage caused by malicious software.</p>
